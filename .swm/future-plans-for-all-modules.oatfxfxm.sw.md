title: Future plans for all modules
---
The multi-level cache originally expected to be handled by the data module will be directly handled by the cache module

&nbsp;

Security has not yet clarified what functions it will provide, but it may be certain that it should be inseparable from the permission group of folia, or there will be a new module responsible for it. What is certain is that disaster recovery and backup services will be completed by security.

&nbsp;

We plan to use minio for disaster recovery backup of files, and the rest is yet to be determined. What we can confirm at present is that hot backup of cache and database has a lower priority.
