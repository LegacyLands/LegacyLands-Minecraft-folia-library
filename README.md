    <p>Based on <a href="https://github.com/FairyProject/fairy" target="_blank">Fairy Framework</a>, it runs as a plug-in, aiming to encapsulate various existing libraries to simplify the development of <a href="https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia" target="_blank">Folia</a> plug-ins.</p>
</div>

## overview

The overall dependence is on the [Fairy Framework](https://github.com/FairyProject/fairy). It probably doesn't have a lot of overly complex stuff, like an unnecessary repackaging of some large library.

## usage

Please download all `artifacts` in [Actions](https://github.com/LegacyLands/legacy-lands-library/actions) and install them as plugins.

The usage of a particular module is described in detail in the module's `README.md`.

It should be noted that the entire library fully depends on [Fairy Framework](https://github.com/FairyProject/fairy), which will completely simplify our development process and provide various functions. It also depends on [fairy-lib-plugin](https://github.com/FairyProject/fairy-lib-plugin).
